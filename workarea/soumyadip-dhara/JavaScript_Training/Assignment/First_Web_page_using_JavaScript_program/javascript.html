        <p id="random">JavaScript is a very powerful client-side scripting language, primarily used on the Web
            JS is an interpreted programming language (loosely coupled).
            JS fully integrates with HTML/CSS.
            Supported by all major browsers and enabled by default.
            JS was initially created as a browser-only language, but now it is used in many other environments as well.
            JS is almost entirely object-based but it uses prototypes where many other object-oriented languages use classes for inheritance.
            JS is a platform independent language. Any JavaScript-enabled browser can understand and interpreted JS code</p>
