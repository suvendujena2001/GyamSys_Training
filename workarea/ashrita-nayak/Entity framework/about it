Entity framework is a tool we use to access a database. In other words, it is an object/relational mapper we use to map the objects of our application with the relational data. In the old days, before EF, we had to do this mapping manually which involved opening a connection to the database, executing a command, reading the data and finally remember to close the connection. However, in case of object relational mapper,we donâ€™t have to do this stuff anymore. So, we work at a higher level of abstraction.
EF provides us a class called DB context which is a gateway to our database. A Dbcontext can have one or more DB sets and these Dbsets represents tables in our database. We use LINQ to query these Dbsets
and entity framework will translate our LINQ queries to sql queries at run time. It means that we don't have to do these translations manually. All the stuff is done by entity framework behind the scene.
So, entity framework is responsible for opening a connection to the database, reads the data, maps it to objects and adds them to DB sets. and return the DB context back to us. As we add, modify or remove objects in these Dbsets. EF keeps track of these changes. And when we ask it to persist the changes, again it will automatically generate SQL statements and executes them on our database. So, this is all about Entity Framework. Now, there are two ways or workflows to use EF. One is called Databse first and the other
one is called code first approach.
