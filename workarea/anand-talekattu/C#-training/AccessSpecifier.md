## Type and Type Members in C#
In general classes, structs, enums, interfaces, and delegates are called types, and variables, properties, constructors, methods, etc. that normally reside within a type are called type members. The type members can have all 6 access specifiers whereas types can have only 2 (internal, public) Access Modifiers. By default, if we have not specified any type, then for type is going to be internal access specifier and for type members, it is going to be a private Access Specifier.

## Private Access Specifier or Modifier in C#:
When we declare a type member (variable, property, method, constructor, etc) as private, then we can access that member with the class only. From outside the class, we cannot access them.

So, the scope of the private member in C#.NET is as follows:

With the Class: YES<br>
Derived Class in Same Assembly: NO<br>
Non-Derived Class in Same Assembly: NO<br>
Derived Class in Other Assemblies: NO<br>
Non-Derived Class in Other Assemblies: NO<br>

## Public Access Specifiers or Access Modifiers in C#:
When we declare a type member (variable, property, method, constructor, etc) as public, then we can access that member from anywhere. That means there is no restriction for public members. 

So, the scope of the public member in C#.NET is as follows:

With the Class: YES<br>
Derived Class in Same Assembly: YES<br>
Non-Derived Class in Same Assembly: YES<br>
Derived Class in Other Assemblies: YES<br>
Non-Derived Class in Other Assemblies: YES<br>

## Protected Access Specifier or Access Modifier in C#:
Protected Members in C# are available within the containing type as well as to the types that are derived from the containing type. That means protected members are available within the parent class (i.e. the containing type) as well as to the child/derived classes (classes derived from the containing type). 

So, the scope of the protected members in C#.NET is as follows:

With the Class: YES<br>
Derived Class in Same Assembly: YES<br>
Non-Derived Class in Same Assembly: NO<br>
Derived Class in Other Assemblies: YES<br>
Non-Derived Class in Other Assemblies: NO<br>

## Internal Access Specifier or Access Modifier in C#:
Whenever a member is declared with Internal Access Specifier in C#, then it is available anywhere within the containing assembly. Itâ€™s a compile-time error to access an internal member from outside the containing assembly.

So, the scope of the internal members in C#.NET is as follows:

With the Class: YES<br>
Derived Class in Same Assembly: YES<br>
Non-Derived Class in Same Assembly: YES<br>
Derived Class in Other Assemblies: NO<br>
Non-Derived Class in Other Assemblies: NO<br>

## Protected Internal Access Specifier or Access Modifier in C#:
Protected Internal Members in C# can be accessed anywhere within the same assembly i.e. in which it is declared or from within a derived class from another assembly. So, we can think, it is a combination of Protected and Internal access specifiers.

So, the scope of the protected internal members in C#.NET is as follows:

With the Class: YES<br>
Derived Class in Same Assembly: YES<br>
Non-Derived Class in Same Assembly: YES<br>
Derived Class in Other Assemblies: YES<br>
Non-Derived Class in Other Assemblies: NO<br>

## Private Protected Access Specifier or Access Modifier in C#:
The private protected members are accessible within the class and within the derived class of the same assembly but cannot be accessed from non-derived class of same assembly or any class from another assembly.

So, the scope of the private protected members in C#.NET is as follows:

With the Class: YES<br>
Derived Class in Same Assembly: YES<br>
Non-Derived Class in Same Assembly: NO<br>
Derived Class in Other Assemblies: NO<br>
Non-Derived Class in Other Assemblies: NO<br>

## Access Specifiers with Type in C#:
We can use all 6 access specifiers with type members in C# but type allows only two access specifiers i.e. Internal and Public. It is a compile-time error to use private, protected, protected internal, and private protected access specifiers with types. So, the only allowed access specifiers for a type is internal and public and if we have not specified any access specifier, then by default it is going to be internal.
